# MCP Server Configuration

This project uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend Claude's capabilities.

## GitHub MCP Server

The GitHub MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json` and allows Claude to:
- Create and view GitHub issues
- Create and review pull requests
- Check GitHub Actions workflow runs
- Manage releases

### Setup

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes:
     - `repo` (full control of private repositories)
     - `issues` (full control of issues)
     - `pull_requests` (full control of pull requests)
     - `actions` (full control of Actions workflows)
   - Generate and copy the token

2. **Configure the token**:
   - Open `.mcp.json`
   - Replace the empty `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` value with your token:
     ```json
     "env": {
       "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token_here"
     }
     ```

3. **Restart Claude Code** to load the MCP server configuration

### Security Note

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Never commit `.mcp.json` with a real token to git!

The `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude `.mcp.json`, so your token won't be accidentally committed.

## Using GitHub MCP

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:
- "Create an issue for this bug"
- "Create a pull request for these changes"
- "Check the status of the latest CI run"
- "List open issues in the repository"

## Troubleshooting

If the GitHub MCP server isn't working:
1. Verify your token has the correct scopes
2. Check that the token hasn't expired
3. Run `claude --mcp-debug` to identify configuration issues
4. Ensure the repository has a GitHub remote configured
